# Execution Monitor as Programming Language Primitive

This code conntains the implementation of a functional programming language equipped with a simple Execution Monitor using OCaml.

## What is an EM ?
An Execution Monitor is a module that runs in parallel with an application or a program and it may detect, prevent or recover from application errors and faults at runtime. 
It is a useful tool because it observes the execution of a program and halts that program if it's going to violate security policies.
